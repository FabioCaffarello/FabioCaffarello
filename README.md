<h1 align="center">Hi there üëã! I'm Fabio Caffarello</h1>

## About Me
I'm a passionate data engineer with a keen interest in building scalable and efficient systems. With a strong background in Python, Go, and Clean Architecture, I enjoy tackling complex problems and delivering high-quality solutions. I highly value well-architected solutions and believe that a strong foundation is key to building robust and maintainable systems. I'm also on a journey to become a machine learning engineer, combining my data engineering skills with advanced machine learning techniques to create innovative solutions.

## Projects
### [Nx Events Lake](https://github.com/FabioCaffarello/nx-events-lake)
An event-driven data lake solution designed to handle multiple sources and also a large volumes of data efficiently through a configuration-oriented microservices approach. This project leverages the power Docker for container orchestration, and Nx for managing monorepo workflows. It integrates non-relational databases like MongoDB to ensure scalability and high performance. The architecture supports messaging systems (RabbitMQ) to facilitate seamless data processing and event handling. You can read the project documentation on the [project page](https://fabiocaffarello.github.io/nx-events-lake/)


### [Master Go Expert](https://github.com/FabioCaffarello/master-go-expert)
This repository contains my projects and exercises from the Master Go Expert course. It showcases various advanced Go programming techniques and best practices, including Clean Architecture, concurrency patterns, and performance optimization. The projects in this repository highlight my journey to mastering Go and my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

### Exploratory Projects

#### [Spark Connect Golang](https://github.com/FabioCaffarello/spark-connect-golang)
A "Hello World" project exploring the integration of Apache Spark with Go. This project demonstrates basic connectivity and data processing using Spark's capabilities within a Go application.

#### [Py-Rust](https://github.com/FabioCaffarello/py-rust)
A "Hello World" project experimenting with the integration of Python and Rust. This project showcases how Rust can be leveraged to enhance Python applications, focusing on performance improvements and interoperability between the two languages. You can read more about my approach in my [Medium article](https://fabio-caffarello.medium.com/optimizing-python-applications-with-rust-a-practical-approach-f900d38a3959).


## Fun Facts
üìö I love reading about software architecture and design patterns.  
üç≥ Cooking is another one of my passions; I enjoy experimenting with new recipes and techniques, and I'm currently learning how to prepare Japanese food.
